## 🗂️ Data Models (MongoDB)

### Item

```js
{
  name: String,
  category: String,
  costPrice: Number,
  sellingPrice: Number,
  minStock: Number,
  isActive: Boolean
}
```

### Sale

```js
{
  date: Date,
  itemId: ObjectId,
  quantity: Number,
  unitPrice: Number,
  total: Number
}
```

### Stock

{
  itemId: ObjectId,
  openingStock: Number,
  purchased: Number,

## 🧠 Business Logic Rules (Important)

* Closing stock = opening + purchased − sold − wastage
* Margin % = (selling − cost) / selling
* Quarterly progress auto-calculated
* 70% revenue concentration check (top items)
* Wastage must always be recorded separately

---

* Mobile-friendly
* Large numbers for sales
* Minimal clicks (fast data entry)
* Dark mode optional

---

## 🔐 Security

* Single admin login

* Seed data for sample café menu
* README with setup instructions

---

## 🏁 Success Criteria

* App clearly shows whether café is **on track or off track** to hit NPR 200,000 per quarter
* Owner can operate app in **<10 minutes per day**
* No dependency on Excel

If you want, next I can:

* Break this into **frontend vs backend prompts**
* Generate **Mongo seed data for Nepali café**
* Generate **API routes only**
* Simplify this prompt specifically for **Bolt.new**

Just tell me.
